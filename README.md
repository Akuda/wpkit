# wpkit
## Version 0.0.1

Wordpress Setup with Vagrant

## NOTE: This project is on the develop branch until the first version is released

NOTE: This is a development tool only. Do not sue this as a production server.

vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater
vagrant plugin install vagrant-cachier
sudo easy_install pip
sudo pip install ansible

On first run, vm needs to download so will take longer

Not tested on parallels or virtualbox yet
